A modern, minimalist logo design featuring two intertwined hexagons in gradient colors (blue to purple), symbolizing GitHub and Gitee integration. The hexagons form an infinite loop pattern, suggesting continuous synchronization. Clean, professional, suitable for a desktop application icon. Flat design with subtle shadows. The style should be tech-focused and elegant.
